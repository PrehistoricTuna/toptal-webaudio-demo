                While the Web Audio API is increasinlgy gaining in popularity, especially amongst HTML5 game developers, the Web MIDI API is still little known amongst front-end developers. A big part of it probably has to do with its current lack of support; the Web MIDI API is currently only supported in Google Chrome, granted that you will enable a special flag for it. Browser manufacturers currently put little emphasis on this api, as it is planned to be part of ES7.<br/><br/>
                Invented in the early 80's by several audio manufacturers, the objective was to create a simple, standard communication protocol for electronic music devices. Thirty years later, eventhough over the years other protocols such as OSC were developed, it is still the de-facto communication protocol for audio hardware manufacturers, and you will be hard-pressed to find a modern music producer that do not own at least one MIDI device in his studio.<br/><br/>
                With the fast development and adoption of the Web Audio API, we can now start building browser-based applications that bridge the gap between the cloud and the physical world. Not only does the Web MIDI API allows us to build synthesizers and audio effects, but we can even start building browser-based DAW's (Digital Audio Workstation) similar in feature and performance to their current flash-based counterparts (Check out Audiotool, for example).<br/><br/>
                In this tutorial, I will guide you through the basics of the Web MIDI API, and we will build a simple monosynth that you will be able to play with your favorite MIDI device.
